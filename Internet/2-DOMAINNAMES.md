## Domain Names

1. What are Domain Names? A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites on the internet. It serves as an easy-to-remember way to locate and identify specific websites. Instead of typing in a series of complex numbers (IP addresses), users can enter a domain name into their web browser to access a website. Example: "www.example.com" is a domain name that points to a specific website.

2. Domain Name Structure: Domain names have a hierarchical structure, which includes: Top-level domain (TLD): These are the endings of domain names like .com, .org, .net, .gov, and many more. TLDs categorize websites (e.g., .com for commercial, .edu for educational institutions). Second-level domain: This is the unique name chosen by the website owner. It often represents the website's identity or purpose (e.g., "example" in www.example.com). Subdomains: Subdomains are optional prefixes to the second-level domain. They can point

3. Registering a Domain Name: To use a domain name, it must be registered through a domain registrar. Users can select an available domain name, pay a registration fee, and specify how long they wish to use it. Choosing a relevant, memorable, and unique domain name is important for your website's identity.

4. The Importance of Domain Names: Domain names are vital for both website owners and users. They make the internet more user-friendly and help build an online brand identity. Additionally, they are an integral part of how the Domain Name System (DNS) works, allowing users to find websites easily.
