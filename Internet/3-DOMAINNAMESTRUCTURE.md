## Domain Name Structure


1. Domain Name Structure
 Overview: Domain names have a structured format that helps identify and categorize websites on the internet. Understanding this structure is essential for working with domain names.


2. Top-Level Domains (TLDs) 
Definition: TLDs are the highest-level domains in the domain name system. They are the endings of domain names (e.g., .com, .org, .net).
Purpose: TLDs categorize websites based on their intended use or organization type (e.g., .com for commercial, .edu for educational institutions, .gov for government).


3. Second-Level Domain
Definition: The second-level domain is the part of the domain name that comes directly before the TLD. It is unique to each website and often represents the website's identity or purpose. 
Example: In the domain name "www.example.com," "example" is the second-level domain.


4. Subdomains
Definition: Subdomains are optional prefixes to the second-level domain. They allow you to create additional web addresses that point to specific sections or services of a website. 
Example: In the domain name "blog.example.com," "blog" is a subdomain that might point to a blog section of the website.


5. Customization
Website owners can customize their domain names by choosing appropriate second-level domain names and creating subdomains to structure their online presence. This customization enhances the user experience and helps organize website content efficiently.


6. Examples of Domain Name Structure 
Provide examples of different domain names to illustrate the structure and components:
"www.google.com" (TLD: .com, Second-Level     Domain: google) 
"blog.example.com" (TLD: .com, Second-Level Domain: example, Subdomain: blog) Understanding the structure of domain names is crucial when working with domain registration and management, and it helps users identify and navigate websites more effectively.
